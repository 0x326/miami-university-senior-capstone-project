# Installation And Running

## System Requirements

* A computer running windows 10

* Preferably 4GB of RAM or greater

* Preferably MS Excel

    * While not necessary to use the software, will be useful for looking over results of
      experiments in progress and making modifications to experiment data on the fly.
      
## Installation

Per our agreement with Dr. Quinn, all local software necessary to run the scale component is
pre-installed on the lab tablet. The web component is served remotely, so no installation is
necessary. Just access it with a browser.

## Starting Application
1. Turn on scale
2. Plug scale into tablet
3. Launch StartScaleApp.sh
4. Open the [web interface](https://0x326.gitlab.io/miami-university-senior-capstone-project/app/)
   and begin recording!
